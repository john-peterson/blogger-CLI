first test your key before spending all day on this confusion 

~~~
gcloud services enable blogger

a=https://www.googleapis.com/auth; gcloud auth application-default login --scopes=$a/cloud-platform,$a/blogger" --no-launch-browser --project abc 

curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
-H "x-goog-user-project: $(gcloud config get project)" \
https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/users/self

#Blogger CLI (Cranky Blogger CLI)

This script interacts with the Google Blogger API V3. Its purpose is to enable
command line blog posting. Its functions are as follows

1. -f "Filename"        is required
2. --publish            sets the post to publish immediatly, the default is draft
3. -t "My topic"        Sets the topic and is required when --publish is present
4. -l "label1, label2"  to set labels

Before you can run the program you will need to login into the google API
console setup an app and download a blogger key. Save the file as client_id.json in the same
directory as the script.

When you first run the program a web browser will launch and you will give the
app permission to access your blogger account.

Don't forget to edit the following configurable variables in bloggercli:

1. labels  defaults are used when no labels are given on CLI
2. blogId  The id of your blog
3. title   The default title to use if one is not specified

#USAGE

Just copy **bloggercli** to /usr/local/bin and put this folder in your $PATH.
Example: 
```
$ mkdir /my/blog/folder
$ cd /my/blog/folder
$ echo "# my first blog post in Markdown" >> newpost.txt
$ pandoc -f markdown_strict -t html -o newpost.html newpost.txt
$ bloggercli -f "newpost.html" -t "A blogger post using Markdown" -l "Markdown, Blogger, CLI"
```
To use it in Mac OS X you must have Python and dependencies installed.
Install Python in Mac OS X: follow [these](http://www.marinamele.com/python) instructions.
Install minimal dependencies:
```
$ pip install httplib2
$ pip install oauth2client
$ pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
```

#TIPS
1. You can use html2text to view the post in the command line 
2. or simply fire it up in a browser to see if formating is correct.
3. Don't forget to use the spellcheck in your editor :)
4. Your post should be a plain html file
5. Try writing a .txt file in Markdown and converting it with pandoc - it's fun!
6. Please enjoy and I welcome public contributions!
